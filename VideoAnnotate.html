        <h1>Video Temporal Annotations</h1>
        <p>- To create an annotation, there is a button on the right panel, named as "Add Annotation". To add startTime and endTime, click on the "setStartTime" and "setEndTime". To add Labels, there are two dropdowns.</p>
        <p>- To edit an annotation, just click on the index button of that annotation, after that any operation performed will be reflected for that particular annotation.</p>
        <p>- To delete any annotation, there is a bin icon on right of every annotation in the table.</p>
        <p>- For the Visualisation purpose of annotation, canvas is there. The annotations will be shown in three different colors, each color has a separate purpose.</p>
        <p>- The green color means that the annotation is complete and is valid. Yellow color means that the annotation is in focus and every operation performed will be reflected in that particular annotation.</p>
        <p>- Red color means that the annotation is either not complete or it is invalid.</p>
        <p>- To save the annotations in json file, click on "Save all and Generate Json".</p>
